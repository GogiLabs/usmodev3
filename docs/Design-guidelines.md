# Design Guidelines: Us Mode

## Visual Style

* **Primary Font**: Inter (clean, modern, friendly)
* **Primary Color**: #FFB6B9 (soft blush pink)
* **Accent Color**: #6C5B7B (muted lavender-purple)
* **Backgrounds**: Off-white and soft gray tones for calm contrast
* **Iconography**: Rounded, soft-edge icons with occasional romantic motifs (hearts, flowers)

## Layout Principles

* **Mobile-First Design**: All layouts optimized for vertical scroll and thumb reach
* **Split Panel UI**:

  * Top: Rewards
  * Bottom: Tasks
* **Sticky Bottom Overlay**:

  * Visible only before login
  * Contains Sign Up and Invite buttons
* **Minimal Clutter**: Use whitespace generously, avoid crammed lists

## Spacing and Interaction

* Minimum padding: 16px on mobile
* Task and Reward items: Card-style elements with soft shadows and large tap targets
* Subtle animations (fade-in, slide-up) on list updates and form submissions

## Accessibility Considerations

* Ensure high color contrast between text and background
* Use semantic HTML for form elements
* Enable keyboard navigation and focus states
* Avoid animations that cause motion sickness (optional motion-reduce settings)

## Brand Tone and Voice

* **Tone**: Supportive, friendly, low-pressure
* **Copy Style**: Short and clear. Avoid corporate language
* **Voice Examples**:

  * "Youâ€™ve earned it! ðŸŽ‰"
  * "Send your partner a little love with a new task ðŸ’–"
  * "Almost there â€” just a few more points!"
